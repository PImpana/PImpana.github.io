                This project seeks to examine crime patterns across London's boroughs, observing any regional differences. 
                It aims to connect crime data with socio-economic indicators. The main objective is to present clear, 
                evidence-based findings to support thoughtful and effective policymaking.

            The area chart below illustrates the types of crimes committed in London in 2024. The most common offences were theft and violence against the person.
             "Violence against the person" encompasses a spectrum of offences, ranging from minor incidents such as harassment and common assault to severe crimes, 
             including murder, actual bodily harm, and grievous bodily harm (Metropolitan Police, UK).

    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;text-align: left;">  <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
       

This bar chart shows the annual median pay across London boroughs, averaged from 2013 to 2024, alongside the national average. 
According to the chart, Tower hamlets has the highest median earnings, followed by Westminster. 
In contrast, Redbridge and Harrow have the lowest median pay, falling below the national average.</p>

        The bar chart below displays the total number of crimes by crime type for each borough in London.
       As per the annual median wage by boroughs, Tower Hamlets has the highest median annual wage, however it is accompanied 
       by high rates of crime especially theft and violence against the person. Comparatively, the Harrow, the borough with the lowest annual median wage 
       has lower levels of crimes across all categories. Feel free to select whichever borough you want!

    <h3>
    Median Annual Pay (Â£) of Borough by Total Crime
    </h3>
    <p style="font-size: 1.1em;text-align: left;"> <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
        This scatter plot explores the relationship between total reported crimes and median annual pay across various London boroughs.
       Interestingly, some of the boroughs with the highest median pay, such as Tower Hamlets and Westminster, 
        report higher crime rates, challenging the assumption that higher crime rates are typically found in lower-income areas. 
        However, this could reflect the influence of wealthier populations and the types of crimes occurring in these regions. 
        Conversely, Harrow, one of the boroughs with the lowest median pay, reports relatively fewer crimes.</p>

    We fit a best fit line into the total reported crimes and median annual pay across the London boroughs. The R square value for the regression 
   is 0.31 which means that approximately
   31% of the change in the total crimes can be explained by the median pay. Although there is a general trend
   there could be various other factors that affect the increase or decrease in crimes and hence we fail to establish a causal relationship.
    The general trend shows with the increase in median pay, crimes tend to increase as well.</p>

                The data used in the visualisation of the charts were sourced from two main data repositories.
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em;text-align: left;">
                1.Office of National Statistics (ONS): The data on total reported crimes,borough wise crime data, and median pay was derived from ONS.</p>
                <p style="font-size: 1.1em;text-align: left;">
                2.Metropolitan Police Service:The data on the level of crimes committed by borough was accessed through Metropolitan Police Service website. The Metropolitan
                        API was used as well.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1em;text-align: left;"> 
               The datasets used to perform the analysis is accesible via GitHub repository.
                The data processing and visualization were performed using Python, and vegalite.

            <p style="font-size: 1.1em;text-align: left;">  <!-- This is a paragraph, it's the main way to display text on a web page -->
                The project presented several analytical challenges. Chart 2 had x-axis formatting issues in Vega-Lite, 
                which I resolved using data transformation techniques from class. A common issue was converting data from wide to long format, 
                addressed by restructuring the data with Python. Combining multiple data sources, especially for Chart 5, where yearly pay and total crimes 
                were plotted with bubbles, caused overlapping. I resolved this by adding a tooltip feature for better clarity and interactivity. 
                These challenges were overcome using solutions from class, including pandas, Vega-Lite, and a strong understanding of the datasets.

    The analysis shows theft and violence against individuals are the most common types of crimes reported. However, a closer look reveals that 
    crime rates vary significantly across different boroughs. We examined the relationship between median earnings and crime rates 
    in each borough and identified a trend where higher-income areas tend to have higher crime rates. Westminster, a high-income borough, 
    recorded the highest number of reported crimes, with theft being the predominant offense. 
    This suggests that higher-income boroughs experiences higher crime rates due to the prevalence of theft implying that 
    these areas must have an increase in surveillance and safety measures.
