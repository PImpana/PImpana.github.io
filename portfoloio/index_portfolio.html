                The first chart depicts the unemployment rate of 3 countries from 1960-2020.The second chart depicts the declining

    <h2> Section 4: CC4. Replication. Re-create, then improve, someone elseâ€™s chart. </h2>
        <p>
        The week's task was to recreate a chart that was poorly visualised. </p>
       <p> In the US, Terry Schiavo was a popular medical case. He was removed from life support after a years-long court battle. 
        CNN, the news channel used the chart on the left to show who agreed with the decision to remove the feeding tube.
        The original visualisation manipulated the chart exaggerating the difference between the support between political party supporters.
        It was an attempt to make the Democrats look like they supported the decision three times more than the Republicans.
        A closer look of the chart reveals that the difference is much smaller (62% vs 54%). </p>
        
        <p>Correcting for this, the chart has been recreated on the right
        with accurate proportions.The original color theme has been retained while the grid has been removed.The Title has been refined and the y-axis title has been added.

    <h2> Section 5:CC5. Scraper. Implement a data scraper of your own. </h2>
        <p>
        The week's task was to scrape a website through one of the presented methods in class (pandas read_html or beautifulsoup).
    </p>
    <p>
        I scraped data on the UK's inflation and unemployment rate from 1990-2024 using the Economic Observatory API.
        After transforming the dataset into a tidy format on Google Colab, I visualised it as a chart on 
        VegaLite. These variables were selected as they are critical for my project, which explores the crime rate in the UK.
        Unemployment rates and inflation rates are particularly relevant as crime is associated with high unemployment levels and high inflation levels.

    <h2> Section 8:CC8. Big Data. Extracting a story from millions of prices. </h2>
        <p>
        The week's task was to create two charts using either of the two UK prices datasets provided.I used the dataset on AutoCPI from Davies and McElvoy
        (2024).
    </p>
    
    <p>
        
        The following chart displays the mean and median prices for 6 stores for Bottled premium lager beer.
        The aim of presenting this chart is to visually represent the difference in average price and median price for premium lager across stores.
         In order to present the chart, I narrowed down information on premium lager beer through the CPI ID of the product. Then, I filtered the data 
         by store ID and then for each store ID aggregated data for median and mean price.

<p>
        This chart displays the median price trend of Premium lager beer for Store 2 as it has the highest average price from chart 1.
        To produce this chart, I filtered the product through CPI ID and 
        then filtered for store 1 data. I converted the data on month and year of median prices into a readable date format.
        Then I created a line chart of the median price trend. This is to see how the prices evolved throughout the year.</p>

        <h2> Section 9:Analytics charts </h2>
            <p>The week's task was to create two charts using advanced analytics. </p>
        
        <p>
            The area chart below illustrates the types of crimes committed in London in 2024. The most common offences were theft and violence against the person.
             "Violence against the person" encompasses a spectrum of offences, ranging from minor incidents such as harassment and common assault to severe crimes, 
             including murder, actual bodily harm, and grievous bodily harm (Metropolitan Police, UK).

    <p>
        This scatter plot aims to explore the relationship between total reported crime and median annual pay across different London boroughs. 
        By plotting the total number of crimes on the x-axis and median annual pay (Â£) on the y-axis, we seek to identify patterns 
        as to whether higher crime rates are associated with lower or higher average pay in certain boroughs.</p>

            <p >
                The following line chart provides information on the trend of the total police recorded crimes in United Kingdom from 2002 to 2024.

            by high rates of crime especially theft and violence against the person. Comparatively, the Harrow, the borough with the least annual median wage
